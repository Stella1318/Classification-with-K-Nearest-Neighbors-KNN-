## Classification with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

### `Classification_KNN.ipynb`

This notebook demonstrates the implementation and evaluation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification algorithm. The key sections include:

- **Data Preparation**: Loading and preprocessing the dataset for use in classification tasks.
- **Model Training**: Training a KNN classifier on the training data.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of the KNN model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Parameter Tuning**: Exploring different values for the number of neighbors (k) to find the optimal parameter for the classifier.
- **Visualization**: Visualizing the decision boundaries and the effect of different values of k on model performance.
